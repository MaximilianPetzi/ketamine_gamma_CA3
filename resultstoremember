results to remember:

Run.pwwT=4000
Run.pwwT2=8000
Run.pwwT3=10000
Run.pwwext=2
Run.pww2ext=2.7
Run.pww3ext=3.5
stepwise increased LFP, gamma and (pyr,bas,olm) freq
no changes in rasterplot
no changes with pwwrec=3

refractory period: max spike freq ca 220Hz according to FI curves

why does ksoma not have an effect? (i think it didnt):
estimated influence of pyr.soma small in comparison to pyr.dendrite: (tau*g*freq)
>>> s=5.3*.05*1000-9.1*0.012*1000
>>> d=5.3*.05*1000+150*6.5*10-9.1*.012*1000
>>> s
155.8
>>> d
9905.8


also, i am pretty sure the ca3 net has no separate ING oscillations according to averaged power spectra

in linearized wc model, having pyr connected to olm and b just shifts the frequency instead of producing theta modulated gamma. 
could explain higher ING shifting PING upwards instead of producing both ING and PING frequency
