results to remember:

Run.pwwT=4000
Run.pwwT2=8000
Run.pwwT3=10000
Run.pwwext=2
Run.pww2ext=2.7
Run.pww3ext=3.5
stepwise increased LFP, gamma and (pyr,bas,olm) freq
no changes in rasterplot
no changes with pwwrec=3

refractory period: max spike freq ca 220Hz according to FI curves

why does ksoma not have an effect? (i think it didnt):
estimated influence of pyr.soma small in comparison to pyr.dendrite: (tau*g*freq)
>>> s=5.3*.05*1000-9.1*0.012*1000
>>> d=5.3*.05*1000+150*6.5*10-9.1*.012*1000
>>> s
155.8
>>> d
9905.8


also, i am pretty sure the ca3 net has no separate ING oscillations according to averaged power spectra

in linearized wc model, having pyr connected to olm and b just shifts the frequency instead of producing theta modulated gamma. 
could explain higher ING shifting PING upwards instead of producing both ING and PING frequency

kext increases gamma power in 34Hz range

averages of whole power spectra seem to behave like gamma power, effect relatively only half as big
